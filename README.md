# World-Trade-2021
This project aimed to explore the impact of recent policies and pandemic on global trade in the past decade for 2021 from three perspectives.
Here's a structured English summary for the **World Trade 2021** project:

## Project Summary: World Trade Analysis (2021)

### 1. Problem Statement and Objective:
The project aimed to investigate how recent global events—specifically the trade war and COVID-19 pandemic—affected world trade. Given the impact of major disruptions like the Suez Canal blockage in March 2021, the team hypothesized that such significant events would alter global trade patterns, influencing economic metrics such as GDP, and affecting different trade categories uniquely.

### 2. Data Source and Description:
- **Data Source**: World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) database developed by the World Bank.
- **Data Scope**:
  - Trade data covering 10 top GDP countries: USA, China, Japan, Germany, UK, France, India, Italy, Brazil, Canada.
  - Data includes import/export activities in 16 different product categories over multiple years.

### 3. Research Methods:
The project utilized Python for data analysis, specifically using Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation, alongside visualization libraries such as Plotly, Holoviews, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NetworkX. Key analytical methods include:

- **Data Cleaning and Integration**:
  - Excel and Pandas were used to merge separate data files, clean datasets, remove unnecessary columns, and restructure data.

- **Visualization Techniques**:
  - **Sankey Diagrams**: Visualized trade flows between top importers/exporters, notably for the USA and China.
  - **Heatmaps**: Illustrated year-on-year changes in trade across multiple product categories.
  - **Stacked Bar Charts**: Compared import and export values across countries and categories in 2018-2019.
  - **Line Charts**: Examined trends in crude oil imports and exports over a ten-year period (2010–2019), highlighting impacts of trade wars and pandemics.
  - **Network Graphs**: Demonstrated trade relationships among the top 10 GDP countries.

### 4. Data Visualization Insights:
- **Top Importers/Exporters**:
  - Largest Exporter: **China** ($3.22 trillion)
  - Largest Importer: **United States** ($3.33 trillion)
  - Significant trade connections highlighted between the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and China.

- **Trends and Category Analysis**:
  - Machinery and Electronics (Mach & Elec) emerged as the most significant trade category globally.
  - USA showed a consistent increase in export activities, particularly in machinery and electronics, while China's position fluctuated, indicating possible impacts from trade tensions.

- **Crude Oil Trade Analysis**:
  - The line chart analysis showed notable declines in U.S. imports post-2018 alongside increased exports, likely due to the U.S.-China trade war.
  - Despite the trade war, China's crude oil imports increased, suggesting different strategic responses to global events.

### 5. Key Findings:
- Global trade positively influences national GDP, particularly evident in economically powerful countries like the USA, China, and Germany.
- Technological products dominate global trade, reflecting their critical role in global economic structures.
- The trade war significantly altered the trade dynamics between major economies, evident in crude oil and machinery sectors, causing shifts in import/export balances and impacting national economic strategies.
